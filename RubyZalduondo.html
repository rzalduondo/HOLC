            <h3>HOLC Security Maps</h3>
            In the 1930's during the New Deal, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation created neighborhood risk assessment maps for dozens of cities across the country. These maps were used to assign a rating from Best to Desireable to Declining to Hazardous. This rating often signified and determined each neighborhood's racial and ethnic makeup, housing conditions, and access to public facilities. Using these maps, banks and loan corporations would selectively determine who they would give mortgages to in certain areas. These maps are evidence of institutional racial discrimination, known as "redlining" and its effects are still seen today.

        <h6>Analysis and Extra Resources</h6>
        <p>
           Historic uneven lending practices have contributed to racial segregation in the East Bay. This has had very material and fatal effects on communities as represented by this data. Crime and homelessness is concentrated around areas that have been rated as D=Hazardous in the HOLC Security Maps. The best rated areas in green have significantly less crime and homelessness, and crime is limited to mostly non-violent crime. There is a direct correlation between racial segregation and crime in this area.
